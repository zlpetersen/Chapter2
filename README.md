#### 3. Write a C++ program that uses two functions and produces the following output:

  Three blind mice
  See how they run
  See how they run

#### One function, called two times, should produce the first two lines, and the remaining function, also called twice, should produce the remaining output.

```
  Enter your age: 29
  Your age in months is 384.

```
#### 6. Write a program that takes a distance in light years as input and outputs the distance in astronomical units:
```
  Enter the number of light years:
  > 4.2
  4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.
```
#### 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute value. The program should then display it in the correct format:
```
  Enter the number of hours:
